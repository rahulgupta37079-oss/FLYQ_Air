### 8. **Explanation (Yellow Alert Box)**
```
ℹ️ Why This Change?

We discovered that GST (18%) was being calculated separately on top 
of product prices, which was incorrect. We've now updated our system 
to include GST within the product prices themselves, as per standard 
practice. This results in a lower total price for you!

To ensure you get the benefit of this corrected pricing, we cancelled 
the previous order and created this new order automatically.
